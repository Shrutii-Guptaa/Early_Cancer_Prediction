A machine learning project that predicts early-stage cervical cancer using patient data.

## Features
- Cleaned and preprocessed UCI cervical cancer dataset
- Visualizations using Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly
- Trained 5 models: Random Forest, KNN, KMeans, Decision Tree, SVM
- Evaluated using accuracy, F1 score, log loss, and confusion matrix

## Dataset
[UCI Cervical Cancer Risk Factors Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/risk+factors+associated+with+cervical+cancer)

## Run the project
```bash
